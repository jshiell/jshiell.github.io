# I'm James Shiell

To pay the bills [I manage developers and agile teams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-shiell/), and on occasion even write code. On really bad days it may make it to production.

For fun, [I write code](https://github.com/jshiell); experiment with home automation and associated toys; play computer and board games; read; and have a dangerous taste for chewy stouts. 

I sometimes post rubbish on  [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@jsh) and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/infernus.org), as time has proved I'm not nearly motivated enough to write a blog.

I'm located in St Albans near London, where I live with my partner and my keeshond.
