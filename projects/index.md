## Software

For my sins, I wrote and more-or-less maintain [the CheckStyle plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/jshiell/checkstyle-idea/). I'm wary of static analysis tools these days, as I find they often get applied thicky as a technological fix for social problems, which makes my work on this tool somewhat ironic.

## At Home

I'm currently fleshing out my home automation with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and a couple of [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) with [Conbee IIs](https://www.phoscon.de/en/conbee2), running [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/), [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), and [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/). This is currently managing a mix of [Philips Hue](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-gb), [IKEA TRÅDFRI]https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/customer-service/product-support/smart-lighting/), [Anker Eufy](https://uk.eufy.com/), and [Xiaomi Aqara](https://www.aqara.com/en/home.html) devices. 

For networking, I'm running a mix of [Mikrotik](https://mikrotik.com/), [Ubiquiti](https://eu.store.ui.com/), and dumb Netgear kit.
